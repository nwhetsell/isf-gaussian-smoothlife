This is an [ISF shader](https://isf.video) for simulating Gaussian SmoothLife.
This particular shader is converted from
[this ShaderToy shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtVXzV). The above
screenshot is from [Videosync](https://videosync.showsync.com).

> [!NOTE]
> This shader is
[available on the ISF website](https://editor.isf.video/shaders/6885276e2f6812001a55f70b)
for the sake of completeness, but there appears to be a bug in the ISF website
that prevents this shader from rendering correctly. Both Videosync and the
jit.gl.isf object for [Cycling â€™74 Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max)
can render this shader correctly.
